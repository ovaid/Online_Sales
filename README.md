1. If n is less than 10: Calculate its Square
  /*soluiton*/
def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
        for i in range(1, n-9):  //here is the correction we have to write n-9 instead of n-10. This ensures that the 
                        //loop runs for n-9 iterations, multiplying the numbers from 1 to n-9 to calculate the factorial.
          out *= i                
    else:
        lim = n - 20
        out = lim * lim
        out = out - lim
        out = out / 2 
    print(out)

# Example usage
compute(4)
output will be 16 that is the square of 4.


2.If n is between 10 and 20: Calculate the factorial of (n-10)
  */solution*/
def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
        for i in range(1, n-9):
            out *= i
    else:
        out = 1
        for i in range(1, n-9):
            out *= i
    print(out)

# Example usage
compute(15)
output of this code will be the 120. because 15-10 = 5 whose factorial will be the 5*4*3*2*1 =120;


3.If n is greater than 20: Calculate the sum of all integers between 1 and (n-20)
/*solution*/
def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
        for i in range(1, n-9):
            out *= i
    else:
        out = sum(range(1, n-19))  // here i write n-19 instead of n-9 because we have 
                                   //subtract the 20 from thhe number if the number is > 20   
                                    //and addup the integers
    print(out)

# Example usage
compute(25)
output of this will be 15 because 25-20=5 , which is 5+4+3+2+1.
